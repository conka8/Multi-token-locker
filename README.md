# multi-token-locker
Smart contract for reusable token locking

## Problem

Typically, token lockers are one-time use, so for each token lock, a new contract must be deployed temporarily. This is nonsense, because it results in a large overpayment, and the blockchain turns into a garbage dump.

## Solution

I decided to make a smart contract with which you can lock different tokens as many times as you like, specify different recipients, and a different timestamp for each.
